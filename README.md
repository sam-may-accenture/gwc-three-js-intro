# A Generic Three JS Project

This project is meant to give you a quick and limited solution for quickly applying and prototyping something in three.js.

## Installation

Download this repository to your machine and install the project.

```
yarn install
```

## Start the App

The app is served with an express server for development that is hosted from port 3000 on your machine.

Run:

```
yarn start
```

Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Testing

Jest has been included in the project. Create `spect.ts` files as you develop. To run those test files, run:

```
yarn test
```

## Styles

Webpack has been configured to bundle sass files. So long as those files are included via the entrypoint (`src/index.ts`) they will be loaded in the bundle generated by webpack.
